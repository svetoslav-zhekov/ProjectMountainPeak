# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Git Flow Conventions ‚ÑπÔ∏è

## Branches
* Always create a new branch for every single new feature or change!
* Never push directly to main, always create a PR!
* New branches are named in this way ```init|update|feature|fix``` then ```/``` and finally the name of the branch. If there is spacing in the branch name, replace spaces with ```-```. Example: ```feature/add-new-entity```.

## Commits
* Commits are named almost the same way as branches, again before name we put ```init|update|feature|fix```, after this we use ```:``` and put commit message, you are allowed to use spaces in commit messages. Example: ```update: changed property name```.

## Comments
* If something is unclear, always put down a comment, after the ```//``` put a space and write your comment message, start with a capital letter. Example: ```// Calculating distance from object```
